Description: Ensuring the precision and accuracy of measurements is critical 
    when collecting anthropometric data. Anthropometrists are usually tested
    for precision and accuracy of measurement through standardisation tests
    performed prior to anthropometric data collection. This package provides
    functions to calculate inter- and intra-observer technical error of
    measurement (TEM) to assess precision of measurements.
