# An Implementation of Anthropometric Measurement Standardisation Tests

Ensuring the precision and accuracy of measurements is critical when
collecting anthropometric data. Anthropometrists are usually tested for
precision and accuracy of measurement through standardisation tests
performed prior to anthropometric data collection. This package provides
functions to calculate inter- and intra-observer technical error of
measurement (TEM) to assess precision of measurements.
