<p>The survey personnel should go through theoretical discussions and
demonstrations on how to perform the anthropometric measurements. This
should then be followed by practical demonstration of the measurement
techniques, measurement readings and recording ideally with a large
number of children particularly if there is a large number of survey
personnel. Once all personnel have had the opportunity to adequately
practice their measurement and recording techniques, a standardisation
test or exercise must be carried out. This chapter provides detailed
instructions on how to carry out an anthropometric measurement
standardisation test as part of a training process in preparation for a
nutrition survey.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="sec-standardisation-test-objectives">Objectives<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sec-standardisation-test-objectives"></a>
</h2>
<p>The standardisation test evaluates the <strong>precision</strong> and
the <strong>accuracy</strong> of the measurements taken by each survey
personnel.</p>
<p>The <strong>accuracy</strong> of measurements taken by survey
personnel is determined by how close they are to the true value with
repeated measurements. On the other hand, the <strong>precision</strong>
of measurements taken by survey personnel is determined by how similar
the values are of repeated measurements made. In preparation for a
nutrition survey while the survey personnel are in training, the aim is
for survey personnel to be <em>highly accurate</em> and <em>highly
precise</em> with their anthropometric measurements.</p>

<h2 id="sec-standardisation-test-mechanics">Mechanics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sec-standardisation-test-mechanics"></a>
</h2>
<p>The general process of the standardisation test is for each survey
personnel to take measurements of at least 10 children 6-59 months,
twice, with an interval of time between the first and second
measurements.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="sec-standardisation-test-parameters">Test parameters<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sec-standardisation-test-parameters"></a>
</h3>
<p>The following test parameters need to be followed when conducting an
anthropometric standardisation test:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The same type of equipment must be used both during the
standardisation test and the survey</p></li>
<li><p>Each child is measured with the same equipment</p></li>
<li><p>The supervisor must observe how measurements are being
taken</p></li>
<li><p>Survey personnel measurements are compared to the reference
(supervisor) values</p></li>
<li><p>Survey personnel measurements are compared to the repeated
measures taken (intra-observer)</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="sec-standardisation-test-requirements">Test organisation and requirements<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sec-standardisation-test-requirements"></a>
</h3>
<p>The following test organisation and requirements need to be met in
order to conduct a credible standardisation test:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Spacious and shady area</p></li>
<li><p>Healthy children between 6 and 59 months or according to the age
group targeted by the survey</p></li>
<li><p>Incentives provided for the mother and children</p></li>
<li><p>Survey personnel are grouped into pairs, but each personnel will
carry out the measurements in turn</p></li>
<li><p>There should only be one pair of survey personnel per child at
any time during the test</p></li>
<li><p>Each survey personnel is given a unique ID. For example if there
are 20 survey personnel, a unique ID from 1 to 20 is given to each
survey personnel. The supervisor’s ID is always 0.</p></li>
<li><p>Each measurement station should have a height board, weighing
scale and a MUAC tape</p></li>
<li><p>Each child must remain with their mother in a fixed station with
a unique ID number. For example if there are 10 mother and children
pairs, a unique ID from 1 to 10 is given to each pair</p></li>
<li><p>It is not allowed for pairs of survey personnel to speak with
other pairs during the test</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="sec-standardisation-test-timeframe">Timeframe<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sec-standardisation-test-timeframe"></a>
</h3>
<p>In order to follow the test parameters specified above and organise
the test appropriately, a considerable amount of time needs to be set
aside for conducting the test.</p>
<p>For a survey team of about 20 survey personnel, the test can be
carried out in 2 half-days such that half of the survey personnel (first
half of each team) measures 10 children in the morning and the other
half (second half of each team) measures the same 10 children in the
afternoon.</p>
<p>It would be possible to have a different set of 10 children for the
afternoon session. However, the results of the first half who took the
test in the morning cannot be combined with the results of the second
half who took the test in the afternoon.</p>
<p>For larger scale surveys with survey personnel more than 20, more
days will be required to conduct the test to appropriately and to
correct specifications.</p>

<li>The supervisor carefully performs the measurements on each child
without allowing the teams to see the values. The supervisor records

<li><p>Each team starts with a different child, and the first half of
the team measures the child once and records the results in a standard
form for the first measurement (as above). The current measurer should
make sure that he/she is entering data in the row corresponding to the
child ID of the child he/she is currently measuring.</p></li>
<li><p>When the first half of the team has done the measurements for the
current child, they should move on to the next child. After the first
half of all the teams has measured 10 children once, the first
measurement round forms are handed in. The teams and the children then
take a break. Appropriate incentives including food and drinks to snack
on during the break should be provided to the mothers and
children.</p></li>
<li><p>After the break, the first half of the team repeats the whole
process and measures each child for the second time and records his/her
measurements onto the standardisation test form for the second round of
measurements. After the the first half of all the teams has measured 10
children twice, the second measurement round forms are handed in. The
teams and the children then take a break for lunch (end of first half of
the day/first half of the test). Appropriate lunch arrangements should
be prepared for the mothers and children.</p></li>
<li><p>After the lunch break or on a new day altogether, the whole
process is done all over again but this time, the second half of the
teams will be performing the measurements. Ideally, the same set of
mother and child pairs should be utilised for the second half day of
testing. However, it may be that some of the mothers will be unable to
come back to help. If for the second half day of testing the mother and
child pairs are different from the first half day, then measurements
made in the second half day cannot be mixed with the data from the first
half day when reporting on the performance in the standardisation test
of the survey personnel.</p></li>
