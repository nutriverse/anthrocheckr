# Anthropometric measurements standardisation test

The survey personnel should go through theoretical discussions and
demonstrations on how to perform the anthropometric measurements. This
should then be followed by practical demonstration of the measurement
techniques, measurement readings and recording ideally with a large
number of children particularly if there is a large number of survey
personnel. Once all personnel have had the opportunity to adequately
practice their measurement and recording techniques, a standardisation
test or exercise must be carried out. This chapter provides detailed
instructions on how to carry out an anthropometric measurement
standardisation test as part of a training process in preparation for a
nutrition survey.

## Objectives

The standardisation test evaluates the **precision** and the
**accuracy** of the measurements taken by each survey personnel.

The **accuracy** of measurements taken by survey personnel is determined
by how close they are to the true value with repeated measurements. On
the other hand, the **precision** of measurements taken by survey
personnel is determined by how similar the values are of repeated
measurements made. In preparation for a nutrition survey while the
survey personnel are in training, the aim is for survey personnel to be
*highly accurate* and *highly precise* with their anthropometric
measurements.

## Mechanics

The general process of the standardisation test is for each survey
personnel to take measurements of at least 10 children 6-59 months,
twice, with an interval of time between the first and second
measurements.

### Test parameters

The following test parameters need to be followed when conducting an
anthropometric standardisation test:

1.  The same type of equipment must be used both during the
    standardisation test and the survey

2.  Each child is measured with the same equipment

3.  The supervisor must observe how measurements are being taken

4.  Survey personnel measurements are compared to the reference
    (supervisor) values

5.  Survey personnel measurements are compared to the repeated measures
    taken (intra-observer)

### Test organisation and requirements

The following test organisation and requirements need to be met in order
to conduct a credible standardisation test:

1.  Spacious and shady area

2.  Healthy children between 6 and 59 months or according to the age
    group targeted by the survey

3.  Incentives provided for the mother and children

4.  Survey personnel are grouped into pairs, but each personnel will
    carry out the measurements in turn

5.  There should only be one pair of survey personnel per child at any
    time during the test

6.  Each survey personnel is given a unique ID. For example if there are
    20 survey personnel, a unique ID from 1 to 20 is given to each
    survey personnel. The supervisor’s ID is always 0.

7.  Each measurement station should have a height board, weighing scale
    and a MUAC tape

8.  Each child must remain with their mother in a fixed station with a
    unique ID number. For example if there are 10 mother and children
    pairs, a unique ID from 1 to 10 is given to each pair

9.  It is not allowed for pairs of survey personnel to speak with other
    pairs during the test

### Timeframe

In order to follow the test parameters specified above and organise the
test appropriately, a considerable amount of time needs to be set aside
for conducting the test.

For a survey team of about 20 survey personnel, the test can be carried
out in 2 half-days such that half of the survey personnel (first half of
each team) measures 10 children in the morning and the other half
(second half of each team) measures the same 10 children in the
afternoon.

It would be possible to have a different set of 10 children for the
afternoon session. However, the results of the first half who took the
test in the morning cannot be combined with the results of the second
half who took the test in the afternoon.

For larger scale surveys with survey personnel more than 20, more days
will be required to conduct the test to appropriately and to correct
specifications.

### Steps in carrying out the standardisation test

1.  The supervisor carefully performs the measurements on each child
    without allowing the teams to see the values. The supervisor records
    his/her measurements on the standardisation test form for the first
    round of measurements.

| Child ID | Weight (kg) | Height (cm) | MUAC (mm) | Oedema (yes/no) |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 01       |             |             |           |                 |
| 02       |             |             |           |                 |
| 03       |             |             |           |                 |
| 04       |             |             |           |                 |
| 05       |             |             |           |                 |
| 06       |             |             |           |                 |
| 07       |             |             |           |                 |
| 08       |             |             |           |                 |
| 09       |             |             |           |                 |
| 10       |             |             |           |                 |

2.  Each team starts with a different child, and the first half of the
    team measures the child once and records the results in a standard
    form for the first measurement (as above). The current measurer
    should make sure that he/she is entering data in the row
    corresponding to the child ID of the child he/she is currently
    measuring.

3.  When the first half of the team has done the measurements for the
    current child, they should move on to the next child. After the
    first half of all the teams has measured 10 children once, the first
    measurement round forms are handed in. The teams and the children
    then take a break. Appropriate incentives including food and drinks
    to snack on during the break should be provided to the mothers and
    children.

4.  After the break, the first half of the team repeats the whole
    process and measures each child for the second time and records
    his/her measurements onto the standardisation test form for the
    second round of measurements. After the the first half of all the
    teams has measured 10 children twice, the second measurement round
    forms are handed in. The teams and the children then take a break
    for lunch (end of first half of the day/first half of the test).
    Appropriate lunch arrangements should be prepared for the mothers
    and children.

5.  After the lunch break or on a new day altogether, the whole process
    is done all over again but this time, the second half of the teams
    will be performing the measurements. Ideally, the same set of mother
    and child pairs should be utilised for the second half day of
    testing. However, it may be that some of the mothers will be unable
    to come back to help. If for the second half day of testing the
    mother and child pairs are different from the first half day, then
    measurements made in the second half day cannot be mixed with the
    data from the first half day when reporting on the performance in
    the standardisation test of the survey personnel.
